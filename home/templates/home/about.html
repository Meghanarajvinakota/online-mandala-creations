                <p class="lead">
                    We are a group of artists , after decades of teaching had a thought: "Just because we're teaching mandala arts, doesn't mean our teaching itself
                    has to be old-fashioned!" We created online mandala creations to embody that idea; to use all of the knowledge  that exists today in order to modernize the way we
                    teach the mandala art.</p>
