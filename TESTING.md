## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser |  Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Brave |  Works as expected |
| Chrome | Works as expected |
| Edge | Works as expected |
| Firefox |  Works as expected |
| Internet Explorer | Multiple Broken Elements  |

| Safari | Works as expected |


## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

On all pages, Lighthouse is flagging a warning 'Issues were logged in the Issues panel in Chrome Devtools'. This is caused by the built-in Stripe element used by the site.

| As an admin I can save users' account details to a backend database so that users can create permanent accounts on my site | 
| As a user I can see and edit my personal user profile so that I can see my saved user details and other information such as past orders |
| As an admin I can send confirmation emails to registering users so that My registration process is more secure, and I validate all user emails when they register |

| As a user I can use buttons on site pages to bring me back/forward a step or bring me to a specific page so that when on an area of the site which naturally leads to or follows on from another specific site page, I can click a button provided to take me there. |
| As a user I can see prices of all products so that I have an accurate measure of the costs of all products that I view |
| As a user I can use my credit/debit card to pay for products so that I can use the online payment system on the site and receive my products, without dealing with cash payments |
| As an admin I can create orders & order numbers for user purchases so that orders can be organised & stored correctly, and reviewed if need be |
| As an admin I can initialise a secure chain of payment processes so that users cannot accidentally or intentionally interrupt the processing of their payment or their order creation after it has been initialised |
| As a user I can receive purchase confirmation emails so that I have confirmation of my order, and a record of my purchase and important order information | 
| As a user I can add products to my shopping basket so that I can pre-select them for possible purchase |
| As a user I can remove items from the basket so that they are not added to my order when I go to the checkout page |
| As a user I can see a running total of the price of all products in my basket so that I can, at a glance, see the total cost of my intended purchases | 
| As a user I can see and interact with a list of products available on the site | 
| As an admin I can create/read/update/delete products in a back-end database so that I have control over what products exist and are displayed for purchase on the site | !
| As a user I can search for and sort products so that I can easily find the most suitable product for my needs | !
| As a user I can see common error pages with user friendly messages and site-related styling so that I can more accurately understand why I have reached an error page, can still see all site related styling and have an option to return to the homepage |
| As a user I can see places where I can easily sign up for the site newsletter so that I can sign up without hassle |
| As an admin I can store user emails so that I can send them the site newsletter |

| As an admin I can edit products on the site's database using a front-end form so that I can easily edit site products in a user-friendly way. |
| As an admin I can delete products from site's database using a front-end form so that I can easily delete existing site products in a user-friendly way. |
| As an admin I can keep an organised database of user profiles so that user profiles can be created and saved to the backend of the site. |
| As an admin I can Automatically create profiles for users upon registration so that users have a profile which displays their basic details, without having to manually create one after registering on the site |
| As a user I can create a profile after I make a purchase so that I can use the details provided during checkout to easily create a profile with all of my information pre-filled |
| As a user I can see and edit my profile page so that my profile details are viewable, and I can change them to match any changes in my information |

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `
